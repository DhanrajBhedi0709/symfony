(1, 1, 'Three Things in Life That Aren’t Worth The Effort', 'three-things-in-life-that-aren-t-worth-the-effort', 'To be more efficient and happy, cut the waste and damaging activities from your life', '<p>By its very&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/wasted-effort\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">definition</a>, a &lsquo;wasted effort&rsquo; refers to things we spend time and energy on which could have been better deployed elsewhere. It is an opportunity cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through its inverse, bypassing unworthy things saves you time and money, and also significant suffering and hardship. The absence of negative forces invites contentment into your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our lives are full of waste. I&rsquo;ve lost entire Saturdays going down stupid wormholes. But only a day was lost. The price can be so much higher if we don&rsquo;t adequately police our behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Internet tensions are a vacuum of your time</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months ago, a friend announced on her Facebook feed, &ldquo;If you plan on voting for Biden, unfriend me now!&rdquo; Sometime later, she popped up in a comment section, arguing with people about election-related issues. Each comment got more corrosive and personal than the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We live in the key swing state of Florida, where tensions are particularly high during elections. With her, and others, I&rsquo;ve seen the dissolution of friendships that went far beyond clicking the &lsquo;unfriend&rsquo; button&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Stuart Mill, one of the fathers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/#:~:text=Though%20the%20first%20systematic%20account,instead%20increase%20happiness%20or%20\'utility.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">of modern utilitarianism</a>, argued, &ldquo;So long as an opinion is strongly rooted in the feelings, it gains rather than loses stability by having a preponderating weight of argument against it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mill was a proponent of building opinions solely on facts. He saw, one hundred years early, the futility of internet arguments. Our rationales are dangerously burdened by our emotions and sense of identity. I have yet to see an internet argument end with two people saying, &ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;m glad we had this discussion. We learned so much.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made a rule when I began writing online: no internet arguments. The mask of incognito is an enemy of civil discourse. I redirect that energy to other things. Is it really worth going through your day, angry about what a stranger said to you online?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They say the lottery is a tax on people who can&rsquo;t do the math. I would say arguing on the internet is a tax on people who don&rsquo;t value their time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Personal relationships becoming a black hole</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly a decade ago, I was sitting on a couch in a marriage counselor&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one could presume, I was going through a very difficult time. My therapist was speaking with me individually without my partner. I think he&rsquo;d grown tired of me waving my hands around, explaining away all the bad omens in our relationship, why I thought we could fix things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said, &ldquo;Let me tell you something. When someone says they want to leave, the best thing you can do is hold your hands up and wish them the best of luck.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might seem like a ridiculous thing for a Ph.D. in Marriage and Family Therapy<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to say. But he&rsquo;d detected a power imbalance between us. I was clawing to save a relationship the other person didn&rsquo;t want to be in. It was projecting me as a low-value person. And more importantly, it was delaying the obvious inevitability of my divorce. Sometimes it&#39;s a relationship counselor&rsquo;s job to identify a doomed partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end? The counselor was on the mark. Good marriages don&rsquo;t usually end. Divorce is horrible and I wouldn&rsquo;t wish it on anyone. But there came a day, many months later, when the sun was shining, the sky was clear. I felt alive and new in a way I hadn&rsquo;t felt in a very long time. I looked back through time with curious fascination, wondering why I tried so hard to save things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We become so acclimated to unhealthy situations that we stop noticing the toxicity. When that situation finally starts to go away, as it should, we rake the ground rather than rejoice. It&rsquo;s almost like a drug withdraw. We should be happy we are quitting. But there we are, itching for more of the poison. When a person, in no uncertain terms, says they want to leave &mdash; let them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When relationships are organic and natural, they have their own sort of gravity. They stay without too much effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Passion is the source of very long term problems</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>You would be shocked by how many partners, who I&rsquo;d only just started hooking up with, urged me not to wear protection. We&rsquo;d had no conversation around contraceptives or testing. They just didn&rsquo;t like the feel of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And look, I&rsquo;m not this avatar of perfect health behavior. I&rsquo;ve just been lucky to get scared straight a few times without consequences. I&rsquo;ve had my scary trip to the clinic, sitting there going down memory lane, wondering, &ldquo;What was I thinking?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should have closed this chapter after 8th-grade sex-ed class. The rate of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011100/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">unintended pregnancies</a>&nbsp;continues to hover around 50% in the United States. I once sat in the parking lot, feeling nervous about buying condoms, and realized, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mature enough to buy them, I shouldn&rsquo;t be having sex in the first place.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hate to use the word &lsquo;problem&rsquo; while referencing a child but unintended pregnancies create other unwanted problems that last far longer than you realize. You are suddenly co-parenting with someone you can&rsquo;t stand. You have daycare costs, food, and myriad unexpected things to manage. Every aspect of your life is fundamentally changed because you didn&rsquo;t spend $5 on protection. After my divorce, I was&nbsp;<em>stunned</em>&nbsp;by the number of single parents on dating apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might feel good at the moment to break the rules. But mark my words, there&rsquo;s a sinking feeling that comes later on. Be willing to say no when it is most difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To deploy these strategies most effectively, ask yourself this affirming question, &ldquo;Am I going to be happy with this decision hours, days, months from now?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was that very question that finally got me to quit smoking. I knew I&rsquo;d never look back decades later and wish I&rsquo;d smoked just a little longer. Life is full of wasteful activities. Avoid them and you will be ahead of the pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recap for your memory: three things that aren&rsquo;t worth it</h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Getting caught up in arguments on the internet</li>\r\n	<li>Trying to save dying relationships (even when you desperately want to)</li>\r\n	<li>Winging it on birth control (wear protection, plan ahead)</li>\r\n</ol>', '2021-01-31 05:14:17', 'news', 'thumbnail/1-Dv-iNtRbfeiko3E6uLdcXg-60640529b959b.jpg'),
(3, 2, 'Top highlight  The 5 Most Overrated Personalities on The Planet', 'top-highlight-the-5-most-overrated-personalities-on-the-planet', 'Our heroes reveal our values.', '<p>There&rsquo;s a joke about Alexander The Great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What made him so much better than all the other conquerors wasn&rsquo;t the size of his empire. It wasn&rsquo;t his strength or intelligence. It&rsquo;s that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great\" rel=\"noopener\">he gave his enemies a chance to surrender before he massacred them</a>&nbsp;and sold their women and children into slavery. It gave him a reputation for being a relatively enlightened guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our heroes don&rsquo;t carry swords anymore. We don&rsquo;t compose epic poems about their glorious battles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We write listicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to go viral like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer\" rel=\"noopener\">Homer did circa 800 B.C.E.</a>, you write something about one of the world&rsquo;s mega-billionaires. You explain some little secret about their success, like how they learn incredibly fast &mdash; or how good they are with people (even if they&rsquo;re incredible assholes in real life). Write it in just the right way, and you have a hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People love reading these articles for one simple reason: They want to&nbsp;<em>be&nbsp;</em>like the person they&rsquo;re reading about, and these articles make it look immensely doable. It&rsquo;s advice and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.freud.org.uk/education/resources/the-interpretation-of-dreams/wish-fulfilment/\" rel=\"noopener\">wish-fulfillment</a>&nbsp;all at once, in five minutes. If you can explain the so-called secret to someone&rsquo;s success in a way that makes it appear simple and easy (i.e.&nbsp;<em>not a secret at all</em>), then you stroke readers&rsquo; egos and make them feel good about themselves. You allow them to see themselves in the rock star everyone adores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, these billionaires rarely demonstrate the traits we ascribe to them, and those traits are definitely&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>the secret to their success.&nbsp;In case you missed the last few thousand years of western civilization, the most powerful people in the world aren&rsquo;t nice. They&rsquo;re not fair. They don&rsquo;t play by the rules. They&rsquo;re brutal. They cheat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often, they&rsquo;re simply in the right place at the right time &mdash; and they exploit that to their advantage, often at everyone&rsquo;s expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are five examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Steve Jobs</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t invent the computer.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-Gary-Wozniak\" rel=\"noopener\">Steve Wozniak</a>&nbsp;did. He also didn&rsquo;t invent smartphones or touch screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These technologies already existed. In fact, Jobs almost&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/why-steve-jobs-almost-prevented-the-apple-iphone-from-being-invented.html\" rel=\"noopener\">stopped Apple from releasing the first iPhone</a>. A covert team developed it in complete secrecy from him, in order to avoid his caustic skepticism. So you might say the iPhone happened&nbsp;<em>despite&nbsp;</em>Jobs, not because of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this aside, is your life really&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;much better because you have a smartphone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I barely use mine anymore&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the toxic waste and byproducts generated by our obsession with smart devices is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90165365/smartphones-are-wrecking-the-planet-faster-than-anyone-expected\" rel=\"noopener\">hastening the destruction of the planet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Jobs was also a pretty gigantic asshole for the majority of his life, and not just to his employees. He&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/lisa-brennan-jobs-small-fry-steve-jobs-daughter\" rel=\"noopener\">abandoned his family</a>&nbsp;and forced his daughter to grow up without a father. He spent years denying his paternity, even after DNA tests proved it. When she came to visit him on his death bed, he told her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/08/02/steve-jobs-told-his-daughter-she-smelled-like-a-toilet-on-his-deathbed/\" rel=\"noopener\">she smelled like a toilet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t just die of cancer. He died of an extremely treatable form of cancer, because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/16551-steve-jobs-alternative-medicine-pancreatic-cancer-treatment.html#:~:text=After%20Steve%20Jobs%20was%20diagnosed,diet%2C%20according%20to%20news%20reports.\" rel=\"noopener\">he rejected science and opted for alternative medicine</a>&nbsp;and juice cleanses. His fans don&rsquo;t like hearing about this because it makes their hero sound, well, kind of&nbsp;<em>dumb</em>. The truth is, Silicon Valley turned Steve Jobs into a saint because it sells gadgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s it&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Elon Musk</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Musk has been promising us an affordable electric car for over a decade now. He&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/01/elon-musk-climate-apocalypse-tesla-spacex\" rel=\"noopener\">used that promise</a>&nbsp;to win billions of dollars in tax breaks and seed money, while actively undermining any green projects he sees as a threat to his own enterprise. Basically, he&rsquo;s the biggest example of corporate freeloading you could imagine. Tesla&rsquo;s stock is plummeting now because people are finally starting to realize that&nbsp;<em>other&nbsp;</em>companies will be the ones to save us from our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, critics say Tesla&rsquo;s solar technology will enable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/3107-a-planet-to-win\" rel=\"noopener\">grid defection</a>: &ldquo;resource-intensive solar separatism for the rich and the geographically lucky who hide in their affluent enclaves.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ouch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that weren&rsquo;t enough, Musk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/11/elon-musk-says-he-didnt-fire-his-assistant-when-she-asked-for-a-raise.html\" rel=\"noopener\">fires indispensable employees</a>&nbsp;whenever they ask for better pay, or to be treated like a&nbsp;<em>human bein</em>g.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-short-history-of-elon-musk-weirdest-fights-2019-10\" rel=\"noopener\">starts feuds with people over Twitter</a>. He also turned his son&rsquo;s name into a massive ego display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Musk told his first wife, &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m</em>&nbsp;the alpha of this relationship&rdquo; on their wedding day of all days. He spent the next several years belittling her career and demanding she put her own professional goals aside in order to masquerade as the perfect trophy wife. In the end, she sees herself a starter-wife to a billionaire who uses women as accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the world admires about Elon Musk isn&rsquo;t his intelligence, or his environmental conscience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s his ego, plain and simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Millions of men look up to Elon Musk because his obscene wealth allows him to do and say whatever he wants, without consequence. He can send the price of stock and assets like bitcoin soaring with a single tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what&nbsp;<em>they&nbsp;</em>want.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Jeff Bezos</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Like our first two billionaires, Jeff Bezos is infamous for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/8/30/17797786/amazon-warehouse-conditions-bernie-sanders\" rel=\"noopener\">abusing his employees</a>&nbsp;and creating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\" rel=\"noopener\">toxic, hostile work environments</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bezos conducts a masterful public relations campaign that allows customers to believe Amazon isn&rsquo;t completely destroying the environment, or working its employees literally to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mic.com/p/amazons-carbon-footprint-goes-beyond-shipping-millions-of-prime-packages-18739965\" rel=\"noopener\">it&nbsp;<em>is</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite Amazon&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund.html\" rel=\"noopener\">recent pledges to save the world</a>, its carbon footprint has grown 15 percent since the pandemic began. At best, the billions that Bezos spends will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/sorry-bezos-10-billion-donation-wont-undo-amazons-climate-impact\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>partly&nbsp;</em>undo the damage he&rsquo;s caused</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that weren&rsquo;t enough, Bezos and his company use every underhanded tactic known to civilization in order to cheapen its labor costs and avoid taxes. They&rsquo;ve literally been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/02/amazon-ftc-pay-flex-drivers-stolen-tips.html\" rel=\"noopener\">caught stealing tips</a>. Bezos himself&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/12/09/americas-three-richest-people-are-now-positioned-to-pay-zero-state-income-tax/?sh=37b4f327b63c\" rel=\"noopener\">pays almost nothing in state income tax</a>, while the rest of us are forced to make up the difference. He&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/12/whole-foods-to-cut-healthcare-for-1900-part-time-employees-in-2020.html\" rel=\"noopener\">cuts health insurance from his employees</a>, then has the audacity to say in public that he has no idea how to spend his immense wealth, other than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-thinks-his-fortune-is-best-spent-in-space-2018-05-01\" rel=\"noopener\">moving to Mars or cloning himself</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He actually said something to that effect:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. That is basically it.&rdquo; &mdash; Jeff Bezos</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Bezos is also divorced. A pattern seems to be emerging here among the planet&rsquo;s wealthiest men and their relationships. Women can&rsquo;t seem to stand being around them for very long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s how they treat people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Oprah Winfrey</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&rsquo;t stand Oprah. There, I&nbsp;<em>finally&nbsp;</em>said it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oprah isn&rsquo;t a hard-hitting journalist. She isn&rsquo;t profound. She caters to the lowest common denominator, the suburban housewives of America, who need to feel special and important because nobody else treats them with any respect. Oprah figured this out early on in her career. They&rsquo;ve been her core audience from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oprah rode to fame on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/health-and-science/2018/01/oprah-winfrey-helped-create-our-irrational-pseudoscientific-american-fantasyland.html\" rel=\"noopener\">satanic panics and woo-woo spirituality</a>. She&rsquo;s a chief architect of the magical thinking that now fuels QAnon-style conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oprah has spent a lifetime coddling intellectual fragility, while manufacturing controversy and outrage for profit. She&rsquo;s a smarter version of Tucker Carlson, who knows how to say exactly what liberals want to hear. She&rsquo;s not progressive because she actually&nbsp;<em>believes&nbsp;</em>in progressive ideas or economic policy. She&rsquo;s liberal because it&rsquo;s good for business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to actual nutritionists, Oprah&rsquo;s Weight Watchers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2015/11/why-weight-watchers-doesn-t-work.html#:~:text=Oprah\'s%20Investment%20in%20Weight%20Watchers,the%20Program%20Doesn\'t%20Work&amp;text=In%20fact%2C%20those%20same%20studies,first%20glance%2C%20Weight%20Watchers%20works.\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn&rsquo;t work</a>. It&rsquo;s built on platitudes and pseudo-science, and encourages unhealthy eating habits. People have left Weight Watchers&nbsp;<em>worse&nbsp;</em>off than they were. The weight they lose is largely muscle mass, not fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oprah doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing to Oprah will always be her image. The second most important thing is influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third is money.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Tony Robbins</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>All the self-help gurus quietly stopped dropping Tony Robbins into their listicles sometime last year. I guess someone finally told them about all the evidence that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/four-more-women-accuse-tony-robbins-of-sexual-misconduct\" rel=\"noopener\">he&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<em>sexual predator</em></a>&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the early work of Tony Robbins. Now his seminars are full of platitudes and product placement. He&rsquo;ll let anyone speak at his events, even Rachel Hollis &mdash; who almost makes me want to expand this article to cover the&nbsp;<em>six&nbsp;</em>most overrated people on the planet. But that would mean I&rsquo;d have to talk about Rachel Hollis, and it&rsquo;s just not worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you learn about Tony Robbins, the more you find out his&nbsp;<em>real&nbsp;</em>secret. He only knows how to succeed if you&rsquo;re a big, good-looking white guy like him. Otherwise, his advice doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the father of contemporary self-help, Tony Robbins has done very little to address&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/tony-robbins-metoo-and-the-limits-of-self-help/557495/\" rel=\"noopener\">the systemic inequalities</a>&nbsp;that often keep his advice from working like it should. Instead, he doubles down on it and refuses to consider the fact that maybe believing in yourself isn&rsquo;t enough in the twenty-first century. It sends a pretty terrible message to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the worst thing about Tony Robbins is that he apparently spent most of his career telling people to stand up for themselves, while preying on women and bullying them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a downer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>These People Have one Thing in Common</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>So, apparently these are the five most successful people in the world. They have the most money. They have the most influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re kind of awful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we&rsquo;re honest with ourselves, we can see how we&rsquo;ve created a mythology around these individuals. We tell stories about them that never really happened. We ascribe pithy quotes to them they didn&rsquo;t really say. We turn them into mirrors of our own personal desires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to acknowledge the truth about someone once they&rsquo;ve been enshrined in your culture.

Auto Close Tag</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most important extensions, As you may have noticed from the title, it automatically adds a close tag that you wanted to write. You don&rsquo;t need any command to activate this extension</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>2. Auto Rename tag</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>When you want to change your &lt;button&gt; tag to &lt;a&gt; you just will need to change the first(opening) tag and the second will change automatically</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>3. Beautify</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of it is straightforward&mdash; when you have an ugly file without any &ldquo;spaces&rdquo; and &ldquo;tabs&rdquo;, where every tag goes right after earlier, beautify will really help you</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>To use this extension you first need to press F1</li>\r\n	<li>Then write &ldquo;Beautify&rdquo; and choose it</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It will automatically make your code more readable and prettier</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>4. Bracket Pair Colorizer</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>It gives every pair of brackets its own color and you can find the right pair quickly and easily</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>5. ESLint</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems and also can automatically fix them. When it defines a problem it will have a red underscore and you can easily fix it yourself</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><strong>6. JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite extension for JavaScript. When you write something at your code and forget how calls function it will automatically offer you to write it down and you can just press Enter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>7. Kite</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Kite does almost the same thing as &ldquo;JavaScript (ES6) code snippets&rdquo;. It has neural networks that help you to code faster</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>8. Live Server</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>When you write your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file you can press &ldquo;Go Live&rdquo; at the bottom of your VSCode window and it will automatically add your changes on a webpage without any reloads and etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>9. Material Icon Theme</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Material Icon Theme adds icons to your files and folders at the top of your VSCode window and you can much easily move among them</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>10. One dark pro</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>One more extension that will make your VSCode workspace more comfortable and handsome. It changes your standard theme to incredible new</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>11. Open In Browser</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s an elementary extension that allows us to open our files right through the browser</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>12. Path Intellisense</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>When we need to write a path at our &ldquo;href&rdquo; or &ldquo;src&rdquo; tags it will provide your a path to an already existing file</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>13. Settings Sync</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest extension is actually the most important. It syncs your setting at VSCode to your account(Google, Github, etc.) and if you delete VSCode itself nothing terrible will happen</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I used and use nowadays these extensions for Web-Development and not only. I hope that you enjoyed this article and that these extensions were useful for you</p>', '2021-03-31 08:46:13', 'technology', 'thumbnail/1-DZKf4nGDTZDn3H4QYMtLFg-606436d5e0763.jpg'),
(6, 1, 'A Mental Trick to Make Any Task Less Intimidating', 'a-mental-trick-to-make-any-task-less-intimidating', 'All you have to do is picture yourself on the other side', '<p>A few years ago, one of my children became obsessed with roller coasters. He watched video after video to study them from afar. He designed his own in computer games. There was just one problem: He was terrified of actually riding one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, he identified the &ldquo;Sooper Dooper Looper&rdquo; at Hersheypark as a potential option: It wasn&rsquo;t too tall or too fast, and had only one inversion. But when we actually went to the park, he started to lose his nerve. I knew he would regret it if he didn&rsquo;t ride the roller coaster after all that, so I reminded him that in two minutes, the ride would be over. Even if he hated it, it was only two minutes (1:45, to be exact). I told him to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/oh-i-see-4de0e2206458\" rel=\"noopener\">picture himself on the other side of those two minutes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So he did, and then he rode the coaster. And when it was over, he was really glad he&rsquo;d tried it. I, meanwhile, was glad that a trick I use often had worked once again.&nbsp;This skill of picturing our future selves is fundamental for discipline &mdash; but it&rsquo;s also important for happiness, which is just as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be kind to your future self</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans are pretty bad at picturing our future selves.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/the-stranger-within-connecting-with-our-future-selves\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Research has found</a>&nbsp;that when we think about them, the brain regions that are activated are similar to those activated when we think about strangers &mdash; but not as much to those activated when we think about our current selves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be one reason that people under-save for retirement. Or why we stay up too late &mdash; because, as Jerry Seinfeld once observed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheGlasses.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a lack of sleep is &ldquo;Morning Guy&rsquo;s problem.</a>&rdquo; But the same research found that when people could actually see (simulated) pictures of their aged selves, then they made better choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This suggests the wisdom of really picturing ourselves on the other side of any hard choice. For instance, you might remember that in the past, you&rsquo;ve always felt exhilarated after an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/the-question-that-makes-a-habit-stick-2a0253a83974\" rel=\"noopener\">invigorating sunrise run</a>. Presumably &ldquo;Future You&rdquo; will feel the same way. Picture yourself on the other side of the unpleasantly cold moment when you actually have to swing your legs out of bed and put your feet on the floor. Instead, focus on coming home, rosy-cheeked and on a runner&rsquo;s high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is really discipline in a nutshell. By picturing ourselves on the other side, we don&rsquo;t have to choose what is immediately easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Get disciplined about happiness</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not just about discipline and choosing what&rsquo;s good for us. Picturing ourselves on the other side can actually lead to a lot more happiness. That&rsquo;s because the &ldquo;self&rdquo; is really&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/its-okay-to-have-multiple-identities-e417f334da5c\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple selves</a>. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory/transcript?language=en\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">psychology researcher Daniel Kahneman offers a helpful rubric</a>: There&rsquo;s an &ldquo;experiencing self&rdquo; (what you are doing and feeling right now) and a &ldquo;remembering self&rdquo; (where you mentally spend a lot of your time &mdash; thinking about memories and what you&rsquo;ve done in the past). I often think about my&nbsp;<em>anticipating self,&nbsp;</em>too &mdash; the part that&rsquo;s dreaming and wondering about the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your anticipating and remembering selves want you to do all kinds of wonderful things. Your anticipating self would like to take a spin on that outdoor ice rink downtown that everyone&rsquo;s talking about. Your remembering self will have fond memories of those twinkling lights, the gleaming ice, and the amazing hot chocolate you sipped afterwards. Unfortunately, your experiencing self is the one who actually has to get off the couch, bundle up, and drive downtown in the cold. She resents this division of labor, and so she suggests you skip it and do what&rsquo;s easiest in the moment: stay home and watch TV. Which is fun, but probably not as fun and memorable as the ice rink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only solution to this constant happiness dilemma is to picture yourself on the other side. If you&rsquo;re excited about doing something, most likely you&rsquo;ll be happy to have done it. You just have to go through a short time of something challenging to emerge to this happy state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m certainly trying to remind myself of this as I embark on several big projects. I&rsquo;m writing a book that involves a long and complicated time diary study, and that often feels hard and intimidating. But I&rsquo;ve written other books. I know that eventually I will hold this book in my hand. My family is undertaking a big and complicated house renovation. But eventually we will move into our lovely new home. I can picture us on the other side, and it helps me to hold steady through the mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for my coaster-curious child? He wound up riding several more roller coasters before we left the park. Turns out they&rsquo;re pretty fun, even for the experiencing self. Good thing he pictured himself on the other side first.</p>', '2021-03-31 11:36:17', 'news', 'thumbnail/1-Diwc1DIGQArX7GSHdVtlXA-60645eb243e03.jpg'),

That&rsquo;s exactly why you should use it to stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a moment to send these seven emails every week can help you strengthen your connections, stay top of mind as opportunities come up, and learn about industry trends. (Slack messages and texts also work, but I&rsquo;m into email because most people have their inboxes open all day anyway.) None of these messages should take more than five minutes to write, but each of them will go a long way in helping to advance your career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>An email saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine opening your inbox after lunch and seeing, sandwiched between a coupon from the local pizza place and a message from an acquaintance asking if you could tweet their new article/contest/course, an email with the simple subject line: &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Now imagine how much those two words could improve your day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People love to feel appreciated. Instead of worrying about all the things you need to do in the morning, take a moment to thank someone for what they do for you. &ldquo;Thanks for all your support during that last big project&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad we get to work together. Thanks for being my sounding board&rdquo; is all you need to say to make an impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>An email to someone you admire</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The fastest way to get what you want is to get to know the people who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/the-power-of-doing-the-right-things-consistently-1e7430bc0efb\" rel=\"noopener\">already have it</a>. Send a message to someone a step or two further ahead in their career and let them know how their work has impacted you. I like to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/how-to-get-on-the-radar-of-people-you-admire-5f6646a65c45\" rel=\"noopener\">use the formula</a>: &ldquo;Thanks to your work doing X, I&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish Y.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been sending cold emails every week for the past three years, and many of those messages have led to great phone calls, which in turn have led to close relationships and interesting opportunities. Amazing things happen when people we admire turn into friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>An email lifting someone up</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in my career,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=conor+neill\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Conor Neill</a>, a leadership expert and the person I admire most in the business world, would send me short messages telling me that he was following my work and that I was progressing. The fact that he&rsquo;d take the time to do that meant the world to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s something magical about someone you don&rsquo;t know very well showing interest in you. Often, it&rsquo;s even more validating than when a friend encourages you, because they really don&rsquo;t have to do it. One sentence can impact someone for a lifetime.

(12, 5, 'Five Signs of a Highly Intelligent Persons', 'five-signs-of-a-highly-intelligent-persons-606d9cb2a2554', 'Accurately sizing up someone’s mental acuity is a valuable life skill.', '<p>There are significant reasons to size up a person&rsquo;s mental acuity. For example, if you are taking advice, interviewing, or communicating, it helps to know what you are working with. Many of the best managers are excellent at reading their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for a one-shot way to determine brilliance, stop reading now. If you are looking for exceptions to the following points, you&rsquo;ll&nbsp;be&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;find&nbsp;them. The following are correlative, not causal. This is an exercise in nuance. Because within nuance, you find most answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>They Practice Intellectual Humility</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked in finance and mostly hated it. However, one of the few perks was the people. The industry attracts and needs intelligent people. Consequently, hiring successful candidates mandated we get a quick read on them. Interviewing is tricky because everyone is putting their best foot forward and trying to sound smart, as perhaps they should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A manager taught us a trick: ask a question the candidate won&rsquo;t know the answer to. Then, observe how they act. A very good sign was when they could simply admit they didn&rsquo;t know, rather than fake it and force-feed an answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This admission is a sign of<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-surprising-personality-trait-that-massively-improves-decision-making-accordi.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">intellectual humility</a>,<em>&nbsp;</em>which is correlated to better decision-making. This is particularly useful in an industry plagued by arrogance. Intellectually humble people challenge their conclusions based on evidence and feedback from others. As a simplistic example, you&rsquo;ll see this when people say, &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve seen, it could be true.&rdquo; Rather than, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely true.&rdquo; They frame their observations as open to critique. They prize truth over ego.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Obvious Signs are Often a Valid Data Point</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, people who refuse to<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/30/17667\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&nbsp;social distance</a>&nbsp;tend to be less intelligent. People who read in their free time&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280193#-General-intelligence-versus-multiple-intelligences-\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">skew smarter</a>&nbsp;than those who don&rsquo;t. Things that smart people tend to do, tend to be done by smarter people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many years ago, I was working retail at a used sports equipment store. A 10-year-old kid came in to buy a baseball helmet. I gave him the price. He held the helmet up, looked it over, then looked back at me, &ldquo;Can you knock a few bucks off? I mean, look at these dents.&rdquo; He pointed at the dents. I smiled and gave him a discount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he left, I thought, &ldquo;That kid is going to do just fine.&rdquo; Being crafty, demonstrating street smarts, and quick thinking is correlated to intelligence. In fact, Yale scientists found that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ba5048dc494bb061d706b1c5bb783495#:~:text=%E2%80%B3We%20found%20that%20scores%20on,IQ%20tests%2C%E2%80%B3%20Wagner%20said.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">street smarts</a>&nbsp;are just as important for employees as their academic smarts. More plainly, you can be a mediocre student, with great street smarts, and go on to be very successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>They are Meta, Literally</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a newly popular phrase, &ldquo;That is so meta.&rdquo; Meta means something is self-referential. For example, a Medium article that is about Medium articles is meta. A video game where you play a character playing a video game is meta. The Onion famously did this with&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;World of World of Warcraft.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to this, intelligent people often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">demonstrate metacognition</a>. They talk about and analyze their own thought process. They are objective and critique their nature. They know when and how they perform best. A simple example of meta behavior is when someone says, &ldquo;I need to put this on my calendar or I won&rsquo;t hold myself accountable.&rdquo; Unsurprisingly, people with high metacognition are often great students and employees. They leverage their self-awareness to their advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>They Know what Killed the Cat</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Intelligent people tend to be curious. They have an itch to know more, to drill down on details, just for the sake of knowing. After all, that&rsquo;s how we learn, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curiosity is an indicator of intelligence in other animals too. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612458936\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">there was</a>&nbsp;a study involving three language-trained chimps. Their job was to use a keyboard to name what food was in an unreachable container. The prize was, you guessed it, food. When the test food was visible, they just hit the correct button and got the food. When the food was hidden amongst various containers, the smarter chimps inspected and tried to peek inside the containers before giving their answers. They knew the odds of winning were higher if they learned more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chimp study is a basic example but reveals the power of information seeking (curiosity). And don&rsquo;t forget, we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/understanding-our-past/dna-comparing-humans-and-chimps#:~:text=But%20for%20a%20clear%20understanding,98.8%20percent%20of%20their%20DNA.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">share 98.8%</a>&nbsp;of our DNA with chimps. The smartest chimps are measured by their ability to patiently learn and troubleshoot problems. Sound familiar?</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Strongest Indicator of Intelligence</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad was an engineering major at the Naval Academy decades ago. He doesn&rsquo;t brag very often about other men. It takes a lot to impress him. But one of his roommates, Charlie was a special classmate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were both in an industrial engineering class. It was the hardest class he&rsquo;d ever taken. Dad said they&rsquo;d come back to the room. He&rsquo;d study for hours while Charlie only studied 20 minutes and then fiddled with his guitar. That roommate still got better grades than my dad, who is fairly bright, and it ticked him off to no end. That roommate went on to become a college professor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the pulsing core of intelligence is the ability to simplify complex problems and solve them, as Charlie did. Often, that skill is genetic. The people themselves don&rsquo;t know how they do it. You can develop the skill as well. A physics professor once told me that, &ldquo;A big problem is just a bunch of small problems combined. Learn to separate them out.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s all a matter of approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Conclusion and Takeaway</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Society has placed a massive priority on intelligence. We often feel pressure to be smart and value those who are. Never forget the value of kindness and respect. Each person has their own combination of skills and gifts and should be respected as such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, outside of a psychologist-provided test, there&rsquo;s no real way to gauge intelligence in one data-point. But if they do these five things, there is a very good chance they are quite smart.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>They demonstrate a curiosity to learn more information.</li>\r\n	<li>They can openly admit when they don&rsquo;t know something. They know and operate within their limits.</li>\r\n	<li>They can break down complex problems and cut straight to a solution.</li>\r\n	<li>They have an acute awareness of their own thought process. They critique and understand it. They use that knowledge to their advantage.</li>\r\n	<li>They display obvious signs of intelligence. They think quickly on their feet and have situational awareness. They wear a mask during a pandemic.</li>\r\n</ol>', '2021-04-07 11:27:15', 'news', 'thumbnail/1-yMzqAnPn-l1-P3-SuHg6fg-606d97142b0da.jpg');
